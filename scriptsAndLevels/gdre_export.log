The following files were converted from an import that was stored lossy.
You may lose fidelity when re-importing these files upon loading the project.
res://.import/balck.jpg-ead060b561d316899f050a1d2ff704c8.stex to res://scenes2/balck.jpg

Use Godot editor version 3.4.2 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
